# Mecenas

Mecenas was released by __[Karol Trzeszczkowski (Licho),](https://github.com/KarolTrzeszczkowski)__ in __[July of 2019,](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ccsl6j/mecenas_a_recurring_payment_plugin_for_electron/)__ as a solution for bitcoin patronage exit scam risk.

His original plugin created and managed a contract, written in the __[Spedn language,](https://spedn.readthedocs.io)__ that shifts the responsibility for making the transaction from the sender to the receiver with time and value restriction.

__[Rosco Kalis](https://kalis.me/)__ later created a modified version written in __[CashScript.](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/cashscript)__ Recently, he's created a new experimental script with support for locktime.
