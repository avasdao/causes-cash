You can easily track the use of each dollar you contribute.

80% will enter a (DRIPP) performance-based smart contract.

10% will enter a (CLR/MolochDAO-style) smart contract, for the greater "good" of the BCH community.

10% will be immediately available, as Petty (Bitcoin) Cash, to the project's team, for seed/working capital.
