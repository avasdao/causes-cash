# Welcome

### Donate to YOUR "good" cause

Everyone has their favorite team (sports, politics, religion). Why should crypto be any different? Pick your favorite team/project and put your money where your mouth is.

### Giving the community what it wants

Infrastructure is the foundation upon which we BUIDL .. But then what? What are we actually BUIDLing? The read.cash community is an absolute treasure, but who is going to come "here", unless they're already part of (or searching within) the crypto community.

We need fresh faces. We need the un-intiated. We just need more users. How do we do that? We need to #MakeBitcoinCashAgain

Who gives a damn? Can volunteer funding work?

This has been suggested by several "funders", who have put their money where their mouth is.

### Best laid plans of the OSS community thus far

Apparently the IFP is far from novel in the space of OSS and more specifically the world of crypto. There have been, and continue to be many innovative ideas working to solve the problem of developer funding:

1. [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/)

2. [Lemonade Stand](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand)

3. [Stable Funding for Open Source Developers](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1789)

4. [SustainOSS](https://sustainoss.org/)

5. [Liberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design For Philanthropic Matching Funds](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656)

### What happens to your contribution?

You can easily track the use of each dollar you contribute.

80% will enter a (DRIPP) performance-based smart contract.

10% will enter a (CLR/MolochDAO-style) smart contract, for the greater "good" of the BCH community.

10% will be immediately available, as Petty (Bitcoin) Cash, to the project's team, for seed/working capital.

### DRIPP (a project token)

Decentralized Radical Investment Performance Pool (DRIPP), is a NEW system based on DAICO, the proposal originally made by Vitalik Buterin and Jason Teusch. DAICO's have NOT been used widely by the community, however, the principles do make a lot of sense for our purposes here.

> TL;DR—Contributors/investors collectively vote to maintain control over the "rate" of dispersement of funds held within the pool. At ANY point, contributors are free to withdraw ANY portion of their own contributions/investments (forfeiting their proportional voting rights).  
Please Note: In the context of Causes.cash, there will be NO (ZERO) expected return on investment (ROI); other than the growth of the BCH community, as a result of the growth in active community services.

### CLR (a community token)

Capital-constrained Liberal Radicalism (CLR) .. it's a mouthful! .. here's another, "square of the sum of square roots" .. remember that, cause we'll talk about it at the end of this lesson..

First and foremost, this will be a "community" fund .. FOREVER!

However, the need for endowments, the generosity of benefactors and the cooperation of States will forever play a role in its success.

> RadicalxChange—We need art to help us imagine new possibilities, scholarship to help us use the lessons of the past to design better societies, entrepreneurship to build new institutions, and activism to bridge ideological lines to fight hate and division.

Voting is managed via a MolochDAO-style organization. All contributors automatically receive shares in the organization. That is the ONLY way to acquire shares in the organization.

> Participants will VOTE (using the CLR token) to substantiate the validity of the individual donators, in order to mitigate the sybil attack vector.  
How? I'm honestly NOT sure yet, but we'll sort it out ;-)  
Thoughts are that there would have to be some depreciation of the "validity" bestowed upon the individual donators, perhaps (during or after) each funding round, to further mitigate "gaming" of the system .. BrightID could provide some guidance towards this effort.

This whole concept was quite confusing to me, but this article really helped make sense of the mathematics behind it. (take a look at the chart below)

### Petty (Bitcoin) Cash

Projects often need money immediately, in order to START producing towards their goals. These funds are non-refundable to ALL contributors/investors.

> Personally, I'm a big proponent of having "traction" BEFORE receiving funding, but that is NOT always feasible. In this case, I believe 10% is NOT too much, but should be enough to get things moving.

Projects are FREE to treat this "petty cash" as disposable income for whatever purposes they see fit. It would be advisable to them to make good use of it, or face tightening of the distribution of their DRIPP, or the possible exit of all contributors all together.

### 0%-fees .. aka the GoFundMe donation model

Yes! Zero percent fees for ALL causes.

Well, GoFundMe does charge 2.9% + $0.30 for "processing" ALL contributions. Causes.cash would use a similar "donation" model, however, it would be a flat 1%.

> GoFundMe also provides a 100% money-back guarantee. But, not sure if that would be feasible for a decentralized platform.

### Why isn't this project open source?

IT IS! (well .. mostly) Just NOT the front-end.

This project MUST reach beyond the fanboys and the crypto-heads to truly be effective in driving greater adoption of BCH. I simply could NOT find an "attractive" UI/UX that was open source for the front-end.

Everything else is available on GitHub.
