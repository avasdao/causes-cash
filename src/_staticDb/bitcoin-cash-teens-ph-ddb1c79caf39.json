    "description": "We started our meetup last March 16 when it was supposed to be March 21. With the help of carmela, we created a group chat then add 1 person in that group chat, then introduce BCH to that person and entertain his questions until he fully understands Bitcoin Cash. In a day, we could finish talking to 7 people or less. We rested March 19, and then started introducing BCH again through chat.",
