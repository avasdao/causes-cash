# DRIPP Campaign

> __TL;DR__ Every cause gets its own token; allowing contributors to manage their individual contributions and vote on __how much__ gets distributed and __how often__ it gets distributed.

Decentralized Radical Investment Performance Pool (DRIPP), is a NEW system based on DAICO, the proposal originally made by Vitalik Buterin and Jason Teusch. DAICO's have NOT been used widely by the community, however, the principles do make a lot of sense for our purposes here.

> TL;DRâ€”Contributors/investors collectively vote to maintain control over the "rate" of dispersement of funds held within the pool. At ANY point, contributors are free to withdraw ANY portion of their own contributions/investments (forfeiting their proportional voting rights).

...

> Please Note: In the context of Causes.cash, there will be NO (ZERO) expected return on investment (ROI); other than the growth of the BCH community, as a result of the growth in active community services.
