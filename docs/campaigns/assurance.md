A group of volunteers came together to create Flipstarter and move the Bitcoin Cash community one step closer to solving the problem of voluntary funding of the Bitcoin Cash commons:

1. Can it work at the large scale we need?
2. Can it be reliable enough to make long term plans based on it?
3. Is it possible to have meaningful accountability with a distributed group of supporters?
