### Donate to YOUR "good" cause

Everyone has their favorite team (sports, politics, religion). Why should crypto be any different? Pick your favorite team/project and put your money where your mouth is.

### Giving the community what it wants

Infrastructure is the foundation upon which we BUIDL .. But then what? What are we actually BUIDLing? The read.cash community is an absolute treasure, but who is going to come "here", unless they're already part of (or searching within) the crypto community.

We need fresh faces. We need the un-intiated. We just need more users. How do we do that? We need to #MakeBitcoinCashAgain

Who gives a damn? Can volunteer funding work?

This has been suggested by several "funders", who have put their money where their mouth is.

> Coinholders know they can easily afford to donate 1% of their holding and will likely make a profit doing so in seeing value of their BCH go up more.—MarcDeMesel

### A NEW Lighthouse?

The community has been talking about a NEW lighthouse since the IFP was announced:

- [BCH Dev Fund: Why Not Crowdfund?](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eubjqb/bch_dev_fund_why_not_crowdfund/)

### Best laid plans of the OSS community thus far

Apparently the IFP is far from novel in the space of OSS and more specifically the world of crypto. There have been, and continue to be many innovative ideas working to solve the problem of developer funding:

1. [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/)

2. [Lemonade Stand](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand)

3. [Stable Funding for Open Source Developers](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1789)

4. [SustainOSS](https://sustainoss.org/)

5. [Liberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design For Philanthropic Matching Funds](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656)
