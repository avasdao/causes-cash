# 0% fees, aka the GoFundMe Donation Model

__Yes!__ Zero percent fees for ALL cause contributions.

Well.. Similar to GoFundMe, which has to charge 2.9% + $0.30 for "processing" fees; causes.cash incurs "processing" fees for its donation model.

__Fees will NEVER exceed ONE percent__

> __NOTE:__ GoFundMe also provides a 100% money-back guarantee. The effort will certainly be made, but not sure if that will be feasible for this decentralized platform.
