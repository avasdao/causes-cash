# Why isn't this project open source?

__IT IS!__ _Well.. mostly, just NOT the front-end_ .. __Not yet!__

This project MUST reach beyond the fanboys and the crypto-heads to truly be effective in driving greater adoption of BCH. I simply could NOT find an "attractive" UI/UX that was open source for the front-end.

Everything else is available on GitHub.
