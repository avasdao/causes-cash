    "description": "BCHpizza.org is a website dedicated to growing merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash. Here's how it works: anyone can post a BCH bounty to reward a pizza shop in any city they choose. Pizza establishments can then claim half the bounty by starting to accept Bitcoin Cash. The other half of the bounty is for the person that convinced the pizza shop to start accepting BCH.",
